# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 [Noida] ğŸŒŒ

- Team Name - code chefs
- Problem Statement - Navigator for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO): Mapping the Characterizable Exoplanets in our Galaxy.
- Team Leader Email - sumeetmaurya85@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). 

Our main goal is to create an optimized and efficient galaxy app with integration of 3 dimensional space where a user can learn about exoplanets listed under Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). 
We are going to build a galaxy from scratch which will include all the exoplanets under HWO and multiple functionalities such as :-

- Gyroscope integration for free movement through-out the galaxy.
- Additionally X and Y axis movement through-out galaxy.
- Added pinch zooming from current point of reference using gyro angle through z axis.
- Collected data from NASA Exoplanets archieve under HWO exoplanets.
- Created a virtual environment to display HWO exoplanets across the 3D plane of view and learn each stars details.
- Galactic Circle (Huge circular net) is build as a frame of reference for all the stars.
- Each star revolves around the galactic circle.
- Each star can be clicked to get its detailed info.

## Code Execution Instruction:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

## Android Setup
To run on your android device, install Expo app from the Play store in order to proceed further. Once installed, 
- Scan the QR code from the Expo app
- Make sure that your app and local execution are happening on the same wifi.
- Load the bundles and you are set!

## Demonstration
Note: This screen has been recorded in low resolution therfore visibility is blurly. Please increase your brightness for better view. This app works smoothly with 60fps and no lag, the video resolution is creating such effect so ignore it.
