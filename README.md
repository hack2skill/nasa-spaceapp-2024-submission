# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 [Noida]

#### Team Name - Astro Analyst
#### Problem Statement - Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making.
#### Team Leader Email - harsh.mishra2022@glbajajgroup.org

## A Brief of the Prototype:
This project uses the various technology
python
html
CSS
data analysis
model building
machine learning
flask for web app
model deployment

Data Extraction was the initial step using the NASA officials website
2)After the long evaluation extract some important data related to suited crop production with no water related disease
3)start building the backend part of this project using various machine learning models to find the best accuracy score.
Gaussian NB model is showing the higher accuracy among all other
I am the solo in my team I basic knowledge about html and CSS so I use these two for frontend
for integrating front end with back end I am using the Flask framework or python.
My project consist of python web which aims for the best suited crop for famer's land with the different parameters in the dataset
