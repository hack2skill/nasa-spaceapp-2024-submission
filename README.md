# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 [Noida]

#### Team Name - SkyHackers
#### Problem Statement - NASAâ€™s extensive open data on space exploration lacks engaging platforms that make learning fun and interactive. Current resources fail to capture public interest, limiting awareness and curiosity about space. A solution is needed to make this data more accessible and enjoyable for users.

## A Brief of the Prototype:
 The prototype of the Space Trivia Quiz Generator is an interactive map-based quiz application. Users explore different regions on a world map and click on locations to generate trivia questions about space missions, planetary data, and astronauts, using NASA's open data. The quiz leverages GenAI APIs to dynamically create relevant questions and explanations based on the selected location.

This approach turns static data into an engaging and educational experience, allowing users to learn about space exploration while interacting with geospatial information. The prototype aims to make space knowledge accessible, fun, and educational for all users.
