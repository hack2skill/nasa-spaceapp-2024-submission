# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 [Noida]

#### Team Name - CryptoKnights
#### Problem Statement - Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects
#### Team Leader Email - goelayush135@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
 Project Overview: The Orrery Web App is an interactive platform designed to visualize and track near-Earth objects (NEOs) in real-time. By simulating the motion of these celestial bodies within our solar system, users can gain a better understanding of their trajectories, orbits, and potential risks. Challenge Addressed: One of the significant challenges in space observation is the lack of accessible, user-friendly tools for visualizing NEOs. Existing resources may be complex or not easily navigable for the general public, educators, or enthusiasts. The Orrery Web App aims to bridge this gap by providing an intuitive interface that presents NEO data clearly and engagingly. Importance: Education and Awareness: The app serves as an educational tool, helping users learn about NEOs, their characteristics, and the importance of monitoring them for planetary defense. Public Engagement: By making space data accessible, the app fosters interest in astronomy and space science, encouraging a broader audience to engage with these topics. Safety Monitoring: As NEOs can pose potential threats to Earth, the app assists users in understanding these objects, promoting informed discussions about planetary safety and exploration efforts. Overall, the Orrery Web App represents a significant step forward in making NEO data more accessible and engaging, promoting both education and awareness of space-related challenges.
**Project Details**
**Project Overview**
An Orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system that illustrates the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons. In this web app, the Orrery model will be adapted to visually represent Near-Earth Objects, which are asteroids and comets that come within 1.3 astronomical units of Earth.

**Functionality
Data Retrieval:**
The app will use APIs (like NASA's Near-Earth Object API) to fetch real-time data on NEOs, including their size, distance from Earth, velocity, and orbital paths.
**3D Visualization:**
A 3D representation of the solar system will be created using libraries like Three.js to visualize the orbits and current positions of NEOs in relation to Earth and other planets.
Users can interact with the model to get detailed information about specific NEOs, such as close-approach their orbits, and any potential impact risks.
**Benefits**
Educational Tool: The app serves as an educational resource for students, astronomers, and the general public to understand the dynamics of NEOs and their relevance to Earth.
Real-Time Information: Provides up-to-date information on NEOs, enhancing public awareness and safety regarding potential threats.
User Engagement: Interactive features keep users engaged, encouraging further exploration and learning about astronomy.
Goals
**Awareness:** Raise public awareness about NEOs and their significance in planetary science and safety.
**Education:** Serve as a teaching aid for schools and educational institutions.
**Research:** Support amateur astronomers and researchers by providing accessible data and visualization tools.
**Tools and Technologies Used
Frontend Development:**
**HTML/CSS:** For structure and styling of the web app.
**JavaScript:** For interactivity and data handling.
**Three.js :** For creating the 3D Orrery model and animations.
**Backend Development :
Node.js:** For server-side logic (if implementing features requiring a server).
**Express.js:** To create APIs for the frontend to communicate with backend services.
**Data Sources:
NASA's NEO API:** For real-time data on near-Earth objects.
Other relevant astronomy data sources as needed.
**Hosting and Deployment:
GitHub Pages or Vercel:** For hosting the web app.
**Conclusion**
The Orrery web app will be a comprehensive tool that not only displays NEOs but also educates users about their movements and significance. Through real-time data and engaging visualizations, the project aims to foster a greater understanding of our solar system and the objects that share it with Earth.

**Use of Artificial Intelligence**
If artificial intelligence (AI) tools were integrated into the Orrery Web App for Near-Earth Objects, they could be applied in several ways, enhancing the app's functionality and user experience. Here are some potential AI tools and software that could be used: 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Chatbot Integration
Tool Used: Botpress
**Purpose:** A chatbot can be integrated into the web app to help users navigate and learn about NEOs. For example, users could ask questions like "What is the closest asteroid to Earth right now?" or "Show me NEOs that are approaching in the next week." The chatbot would analyze the user's query and provide the appropriate response by fetching relevant data.
**How It Works:**
NLP algorithms interpret user input.
The bot queries the NEO database or API to fetch the requested information.
The response is then presented in a user-friendly format.
**3. User Behavior Personalization
Tool Used:** Recommendation Engines (Collaborative Filtering Algorithms), AI for UI Personalization
**Purpose:** AI can be used to personalize the user experience by learning from a user's interactions within the app. For instance, if a user frequently explores asteroids of a certain size or velocity, the app could recommend similar NEOs for further exploration.
**How It Works:**
AI algorithms monitor user interactions, such as the types of NEOs they click on, and recommend related objects.
User data is analyzed and AI adjusts the interface based on preferences.
