## A Brief of the Prototype:
  # GLOBE Quest Web Application - README

Welcome to *GLOBE Quest, an innovative and interactive web application designed to immerse students in the world of environmental education through engaging narratives, competitive gameplay, and real-world scientific challenges based on **NASA’s GLOBE Protocol*.

## Features Offered by GLOBE Quest

### Interactive Storytelling
Students will embark on a captivating narrative journey that explores various environmental themes. This storytelling approach allows students to engage in hands-on learning while navigating through real-world challenges.

### Competitive Gameplay
Students can compete with their peers from other schools in real-time. Through various gameplay modes, they earn points and climb the leaderboard by successfully completing environmental tasks and challenges.

### GLOBE-Based Challenges
Leveraging the *GLOBE Protocol*, students will collect real environmental data while learning about the pressing ecological issues of today. Each challenge allows students to make a tangible contribution to global environmental research.

### Educational Resources
The platform offers a wealth of educational resources, providing students with access to instructional content and GLOBE protocols that can enhance their understanding and learning experience.

### Team Collaboration
Students can collaborate with up to two classmates in a team, working together to solve puzzles, complete challenges, and contribute data to scientific research.

### Real-World Impact
GLOBE Quest empowers students to make a positive environmental impact by contributing to scientific data and research, ensuring their efforts help in addressing global environmental concerns.

### Dynamic Battle Mode
In *Battle Mode*, students compete head-to-head with other teams. The challenges are dynamic and designed around the GLOBE protocols, promoting learning through competition. As students progress, they must use what they've learned to face hands-on challenges, helping their team score higher while climbing the leaderboard.

## How It Works

### 1. Backend Integration
This web application is built with *Node.js, **Express, and **MongoDB. The database is structured into two collections: one for **Users* and another for *Teams*. Each user has the option to create a team and add a maximum of two members. Once their team is formed, they can dive into the learning journey, competing in challenges and updating their leaderboard scores.

*Backend Architecture:*
- *User Authentication*: Secure login system that allows students to sign up, create teams, and track their progress.
- *Database*: Connected to two collections—Users and Teams. This allows efficient management of user data, team dynamics, and challenge progress.
  
### 2. Team Dynamics and Scoring
Each user can form a team with up to two additional members. This feature encourages collaboration and collective learning as teams compete, complete tasks, and earn points. The leaderboard dynamically updates based on team performance in various challenges.

### 3. Storytelling and Learning Challenges
The application features an immersive storytelling experience where each team must complete environmental challenges based on the GLOBE protocols. The challenges are interactive and test their knowledge while they contribute to environmental research in real time.
