## A Brief of the Prototype:
  The prototype you're building will be an interactive and innovative platform that connects space technology with societal benefits. Here’s a brief of its key components:

  Space-Tech Impact Map: This core feature will display a dynamic map using NASA's satellite data, showcasing global space tech impacts like satellite installations, research centers, and observatories. It will highlight areas benefiting from space technology in sectors like disaster management, agriculture, and climate monitoring.
  
  Community-Driven Data Integration: Users from different communities will contribute local data, including feedback on space tech benefits or challenges. Contributions will be categorized for easy navigation, offering insights into how space tech affects specific regions.
  
  Geo-Spatial Analysis & Visualization: This will involve detailed analytics, displaying trends such as environmental shifts or improved infrastructure due to space tech. The map will feature heat maps, growth charts, and other visual insights to illustrate space tech’s impact on agriculture, communication, and education.
  
  Citizen Science Integration: This section will encourage users to conduct local research projects using NASA's data. Community members will be able to track environmental metrics like pollution or urban heat islands and collaborate with researchers globally.
  
  AR/VR Exploration Mode: For an immersive experience, users can explore the impact map in 3D using AR/VR technology. This feature will enable them to visualize space research impacts in their regions, enhancing engagement with the platform.
  
  Sustainability & Policy Tracker: This feature will link space technology’s role with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It will track relevant policies and community recommendations on how space tech can support sustainable growth globally.
  
  The app's tech stack will involve front-end technologies like React.js, Three.js, D3.js for visualizations and AR/VR, Node.js and Express for backend services, and MongoDB for community data storage. For geo-spatial analysis, Google Earth Engine and Mapbox will be integrated. The app will be deployed on AWS or GCP for scalability and real-time access to NASA’s data.
  
  This prototype bridges space science with community development, making space tech more accessible to non-scientists while fostering collaboration between citizens, researchers, and NASA.
