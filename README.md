# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 [Noida]

#### Team Name - Codee
#### Problem Statement - Landsat Reflectance Data
#### Team Leader Email -wjsuntha@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
Our solution offers real-time access to Landsat satellite reflectance data, aimed at applications like agriculture, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. It integrates a Flask backend to process satellite data and a React frontend for visualization.

How it Works:
Data Processing: The backend processes Landsat reflectance data dynamically, preparing it for visualization.
Visualization: The frontend displays this data on an interactive Leaflet.js map, highlighting the relevant geographical area, along with a Plotly.js graph that visualizes the reflectance values for easy analysis.
Seamless Interaction: Users can interact with the data visually through a simple interface, making satellite data accessible for non-experts in real-time.

## Code Execution Instruction:
Testing the Application:

Open the frontend in your browser, click the "Fetch Data" button to visualize the reflectance data on the map and chart.
