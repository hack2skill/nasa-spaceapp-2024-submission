## A Brief of the Prototype:
  The prototype is an interactive web-based map application designed to provide real-time geographic data visualization and user-controlled features. It integrates multiple layers of geographic information, including OpenStreetMap (OSM) tiles, air quality index (AQI), vegetation, highways, terrain, and satellite imagery. 

Key features of the prototype include:

1. **Map Layer Toggling**: Users can easily toggle different map layers such as vegetation, highways, satellite view, terrain, and pollution, allowing for customized map visualization.
  
2. **Air Quality Information**: An AQI widget can be displayed for specific cities, showing real-time air quality data with a user-friendly interface.

3. **Location-based Markers**: Users can mark specific cities on the map and calculate the distance between marked locations using a routing system.

4. **Rainfall Data**: The prototype allows toggling a rainfall layer to display precipitation data over the map, adding an environmental monitoring feature.

5. **Voice and Text Commands**: The application supports both text-based input and voice commands to control the mapâ€™s features (e.g., zooming in/out, going to a location, toggling layers).

6. **History Logging**: Each user action, such as toggling a layer or marking a city, is logged and displayed in a history list for reference.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing seamless interaction between the user and the map interface for visualizing geographic and environmental data.
