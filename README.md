## A Brief of the Prototype:
  Our project is an exciting Unity-based game that combines education and exploration in a fun, interactive way. Players take control of a virtual rover to explore various exoplanets, each with unique characteristics and real-world scientific data. What makes this game truly engaging is the ability to chain multiple commands at once—like "Move 5 units, Rotate 30 degrees, Move 6 units, Rotate 49 degrees, and Search." The rover will execute these commands one by one, allowing players to strategize and plan their path across the alien terrain. It offers a sense of control and curiosity, as users guide the rover to key points of interest on different exoplanets. At these points, players can trigger a “Search” function, where the rover uncovers interesting facts about the planet, such as the atmospheric composition or whether life could exist there. For example, on one planet, players may discover, "This exoplanet contains high levels of methane, making it extremely toxic and uninhabitable." The game features *simple, drag-and-drop controls, making it suitable for both younger children and older users alike. Despite its simplicity, the game maintains an ideal balance between *challenging navigation and learning, ensuring that players of all ages stay engaged while exploring the wonders of space. By blending scientific facts with playful, hands-on exploration Our project serves as an educational tool that breaks down complex astronomical concepts into an experience that is not only fun but also deeply informative.
