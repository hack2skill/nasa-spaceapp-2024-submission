## A Brief of the Prototype:
  What is your solution? and how it works.

  Landsat project focuses on real-time satellite tracking and location monitoring, leveraging satellite data to inform users about the position of the Landsat satellite relative to their specified locations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key features and components of your project:

Project Overview
Objective: To create an interactive web application that tracks the Landsat satellite's location and notifies users when it is within a specific range of a user-defined location.
Key Features
Map-Based Location Input:

Users can enter longitude and latitude coordinates directly or select a location on a map interface using a pin. This allows for accurate tracking of user-defined locations.
Live Satellite Tracking:

The application displays the live location of the Landsat satellite on the map, refreshing the position every 2 seconds. This ensures that users receive up-to-date information regarding the satellite's proximity to their location.
Notification System:

When the Landsat satellite comes within a user-defined radius (defaulting to 1 km) around the specified location, the system sends notifications via email. Users receive alerts indicating that the satellite is in range, along with the time duration it remains within that area.
User-Friendly Interface:

The application features a responsive design that works well across devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
A visually appealing layout makes it easy for users to interact with the map and input their desired locations.
Radius Selection:

Users can specify a radius between 0.5 km to 100 km to determine how close the satellite needs to be to trigger a notification. This flexibility allows users to customize their experience based on their needs.
