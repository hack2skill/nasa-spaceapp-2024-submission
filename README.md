## A Brief of the Prototype:
Interact and Test the models here - https://exoplanetarium.netlify.app/
<br>
The idea presented in *EXOPLANETARIUM* by Team CODE4CHANGE is a powerful and innovative platform that brings together real-time data and advanced visualizations to explore exoplanets, making the vast universe more accessible to students, researchers, and enthusiasts alike.  
<br>

This platform is designed to simulate complex exoplanet discovery methods, provide detailed habitability analysis, and display planetary relationships and discovery advancements using 3D visualizations. By utilizing NASA data, the tool not only creates accurate artistic representations but also offers real-time comparisons between Earth and various exoplanets, analyzing factors such as mass, radius, orbital period, and stellar temperature. The inclusion of clustering techniques enhances the accuracy of habitability predictions, making it an immersive educational tool.  
<br>

*Key Features Include:*  
<br>

- *3D Exoplanet Visualization:* Users can explore planets in an interactive 3D environment.  
- *Habitability Estimation:* The platform calculates habitability scores using advanced models and real-time data.  
- *Discovery Simulation:* A feature that simulates how various detection methods work, fostering a deeper understanding of the process.  
- *Earth Comparisons:* It enables comparisons between Earth and exoplanets based on key features like mass and stellar temperature.  
- *Data-Driven Graphs:* The tool provides visual aids like scatter plots and heatmaps to analyze planetary data and patterns.  
<br>

The technical stack includes *React.js, **Three.js, **Python* (with *TensorFlow* and *Scikit-learn), and **Node.js*, making the platform highly robust and scalable. The team plans to expand the tool with additional features like mobile app integration, virtual reality for enhanced user engagement, and continuous updates with new discoveries.  
<br>

This project stands out due to its unique combination of educational focus, artistic 3D representations, and in-depth scientific analysis, positioning it as a valuable tool for both learning and discovery in the realm of exoplanetary science.

## Code Execution Instruction:

## How to Run the React Web Application  

*1. Clone the Repository*  
Open your terminal and run the following command:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/exoplanetarium.git  
cd exoplanetarium
This will download the project and move you into its directory.

Install Dependencies
Once in the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm:

npm install
This command installs all the necessary packages for the application to run.


Start the Application
After the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

npm run dev
This will start the local development server, allowing you to interact with the application in your browser.


Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view and interact with the Exoplanetarium platform.
