#### Team Name - DevDynamo

#### Problem Statement - 
Your challenge is to develop an easy-to-use, web-based application that supports the comparison of ground-based observations with Landsat data by allowing users to define a target location, receive notifications when Landsat is to pass over that location, and then access and display the corresponding Landsat SR data.
