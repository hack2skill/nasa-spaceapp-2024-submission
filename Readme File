🌍 Water Quality Monitoring and Geocoding Application

This project is a Water Quality Monitoring and Geocoding Application that provides a comprehensive platform for mapping, visualizing, and analyzing water quality data. It leverages the power of OpenStreetMap, Nominatim, and Chart.js to offer users an interactive experience for submitting, visualizing, and interpreting water quality metrics.

🚀 Features

Geocoding Functionality: Converts user-provided addresses into geographic coordinates using the Nominatim service from OpenStreetMap. Water Quality Data Integration: Users can submit water quality data (pH, turbidity, contaminant levels, etc.) via a user-friendly form. Interactive Map: Visualizes water quality data on a map with clustering techniques to avoid clutter and provide insights into regional trends. Pollution Reporting: Users can report water quality pollution incidents directly on the map by selecting the location. Data Visualization: Display water quality trends over time using charts powered by Chart.js. Document Submission: Upload and store documents related to water quality incidents. 🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Backend: Node.js, Express.js Database: MongoDB (Spatial indexing for quick location-based queries) Geospatial Mapping: OpenStreetMap, Nominatim API, Leaflet.js Data Visualization: Chart.js 📋 Project Setup

Water Quality Map with Clustering Pollution Reporting Form Data Visualization Charts 📑 Usage

Submit Water Quality Data: Fill in the form with metrics like pH, turbidity, and other relevant parameters. Report Pollution Incidents: Choose a location and provide details about the pollution incident. Visualize Trends: Use the interactive charts and map to analyze water quality data across different locations and time periods. 🔗 API Integration

Nominatim API: Converts user-provided addresses into geographic coordinates. OpenStreetMap: Provides the mapping platform for visualizing data. 🤝 Contributing
