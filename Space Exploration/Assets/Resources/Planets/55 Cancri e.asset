  information:
  - 55 Cancri e is believed to be composed largely of carbon, including possible
    diamond layers.
  - Its surface conditions could include extreme temperatures and high pressures,
    making it a unique world of carbon-based materials.
  - The planet is about 1.8 times the size of Earth and has a density significantly
    higher, indicating a rocky composition.
  - ' It orbits its star much closer than Mercury orbits the Sun, leading to extreme
    surface conditions.'
  - 55 Cancri e was discovered using the radial velocity method, which measures the
    gravitational influence on its star.
  - The planet completes an orbit around its star in just 0.74 Earth days.
  - The close proximity to its star results in extreme temperature differences between
    the day and night sides.
  - It orbits a Sun-like star with a similar spectral type (G) as the Sun.
