  information:
  - It is the first Earth-sized exoplanet found in the habitable zone of its star,
    potentially allowing for liquid water.
  - It orbits a red dwarf star, which is cooler and less luminous than our Sun.
  - The planet completes an orbit around its star in about 130 Earth days.
  - Its location in the habitable zone suggests that it could have water in liquid
    form on its surface.
  - It is one of five planets orbiting its star, contributing to our understanding
    of multi-planet systems.
  - The star it orbits has a surface temperature of about 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit
    (2,000 degrees Celsius), much cooler than the Sun.
  - If Kepler-186f has moons, they might also be in the habitable zone, increasing
    the potential for life.
  - It is located approximately 560 light-years away from Earth, making it one of
    the more distant potentially habitable planets.
