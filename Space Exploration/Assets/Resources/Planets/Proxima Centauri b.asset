  information:
  - Proxima Centauri b is the closest known exoplanet to our solar system, located
    just over 4 light-years away.
  - It resides in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, where temperatures might
    allow for liquid water.
  - ' Its location and star type make it a prime candidate for studying potential
    habitability.'
  - The planet completes an orbit around its star in approximately 11.2 Earth days.
  - The planet might have moons that could also be within the habitable zone, enhancing
    its potential for habitability.
  - "The presence of an atmosphere and the star\u2019s activity could affect the
    planet\u2019s climate and potential for life."
  - Proxima Centauri b is a key target for future interstellar missions and telescopic
    observations.
  - The planet's atmosphere, if present, could provide clues about its habitability
    and surface conditions.
