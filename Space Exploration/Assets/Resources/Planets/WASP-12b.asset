  information:
  - The planet is significantly stretched into an elliptical shape due to its close
    orbit around its star.
  - WASP-12b has a surface temperature around 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit (1,200 degrees
    Celsius).
  - "The planet\u2019s atmosphere is so hot that it is gradually escaping into space."
  - "WASP-12b\u2019s atmosphere is extremely dark, absorbing most of the light that
    reaches it."
  - It completes an orbit around its star in just 1.1 Earth days, leading to extreme
    temperature variations.
  - It orbits a spectral type F star, which is hotter and more luminous than the
    Sun.
  - "The planet\u2019s atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium, and possible metal vapor,
    contributing to its unique features."
  - Studying WASP-12b helps scientists understand the behavior of exoplanetary atmospheres
    under extreme conditions.
